			<h2>Why a healthy diet is important</h2>
			<p>Although exercise can help you lose body fat and tone muscles, 
				it's also important to have a healthy diet. In the short term, 
				a poor diet can contribute to stress, tiredness, and the capacity 
				to work. Over time, it may add to the risk of developing some illnesses 
				and health problems such as obesity, tooth decay, high blood pressure, 
				high cholesterol, heart disease, some cancers, depression, osteoporosis, 
				and type-2 diabetes. You've probably heard the old saying, "you are what 
				you eat." So, to be in shape, you need to eat right.
			</p>
			<h3>What is a healthy diet?</h3>
			<p>A healthy diet is more than eating a salad for lunch or buying
				fat-free yogurt. A healthy diet is a balanced diet that gives your body
				the nutrients it needs to function properly. And that means getting the 
				majority of your daily calories from fresh fruits and vegetables, 
				whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean proteins.
			</p>
			<h3>When should you start?</h3>
			<p>Right now! No matter how old you are, how you've eaten in the past, 
				whether you exercise daily or almost never, the benefits of a healthy
				diet begin today... if you start today!
			</p>
			<h3>Where can you find healthy food?</h3>
			<p>Healthy food is available almost everywhere. You just have to plan ahead. 
				Almost all restaurants and grocery stores offer healthy options nowadays. 
				And, although it may be more expensive than unhealthy food, the extra 
				money you spend on buying healthy food will be repaid many times over 
				from a healthy life.
